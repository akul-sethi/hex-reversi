  /**
   * The constructor for an abstract reversi model.
   * Some design choices:
   * The constructor is passed in a Map of CubeCoord to Player. We originally had it designed
   * as getting passed in a list of CubeCÃ¥oords instead, but due to not knowing where the starting
   * tiles would then be, we decided to have it get passed a Map.
   * The constructor is also passed a List of players instead of Queue. This is because we
   * thought it would be better to have the constructor do more and be easier to use.
   * In some versions, the board is started as empty, and the players are given an amount of
   * start moves to place tiles without capturing, creating the board layout. This will be easy
   * to implement if needed in the future, with multiple constructors.
   *
   * @param hexMap  A Map of CubeCoords to Players.
   * @param players A List of Players, converted to a queue and stored (by order).
