A player Interface is necessary to interact with the model and create an abstraction layer to allow
for different types of players.

It is necessary for it to have a play move method which for human players can just mean playing the
move indicated by a human, but for an AI, could mean making queries to the model to determine its
state, and then sending the correct command to the model.

It necessary for it to have access to the model, so that it can first determine the range of
coordinate to query, then to actually query the coordinates to determine the state of the game,
and then finally send a command to the model based on this information.

The controller can then create a game by creating different types of players based on the game type,
passing them a model and an Interface to user input if the player type requires that (is human) and
then repeatedly calling play move between the players while viewing the game.
