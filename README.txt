Design Notes
Hex orientation:
    pointy top
    flat top
Coordinate system:
    cube
    axial
    offset (odd-r, even-r, odd-q, even-q)

Possible additional functionality:
    multiple players
    different board shapes
    multiple pieces in a row

Thoughts:
    Player class instead of using ints
    Score?
    Rendering move preview
    Maybe no CubeCord
